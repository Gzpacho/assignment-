The site is fully responsive and includes multiple interactive features like navigation menus, a form for online orders, and a beautiful landing page with a background image.

Responsive design using modern CSS techniques.
Form handling with various input types including text, radio buttons, checkboxes, date pickers, and file uploads.
Interactive UI elements powered by JavaScript.
Principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) to ensure a user-friendly experience.
